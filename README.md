# C2-Ransomware
This is my experimental tool. It acts like backdoor and additionally it can encrypt/decyrpt files
----------------------------
You must write "encrypt, decrypt, or arbitrary command, or 'exit'". For encryption, you need just to write "encrypt", after that it will want you to write the path. It will look for .txt files and it will automatically encrypt them. I recommend you don't run it, if you do make new directory and add .txt files inside it and run ransomware. Basically, it could be improved (like it could be more user-friendly), but I forgot about it:((
